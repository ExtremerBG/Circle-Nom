## Run Instructions

To run the source code, open the folder with your preferred IDE. Ensure you have the `pygame` library installed; otherwise, the game won't work. Install it using `pip install pygame`.

Alternatively, you can run the game using the executable found in the Releases section or create your own by running the `.spec` file with `pyinstaller`. Note: Both executables, whether from Releases or your own compilation, will **not** have a digital signature. As a result, some antivirus programs may flag them as malicious and delete them.

## Controls

Move the character using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or the arrow keys on your keyboard.
Change the music using the `Q` & `E` keys - previous & next song.

## Goal

Score as many points as possible by eating randomly spawned food.
