## Run Instructions

To run the source code, open the folder with your preferred IDE. Ensure you have `pygame`,  `gif-pygame` and `numpy` libraries installed; otherwise, it won't work. Assuming you have `pip`, install them using:

```sh
pip install pygame
```

```sh
pip install gif-pygame
```

```sh
pip install numpy
```

Alternatively, you can run the game using the executable found in the Releases section or create your own by running the `main.spec` file with `pyinstaller`. 
- Note: Both executables, whether from Releases or your own compilation, will **not** have a digital signature. As a result, some antivirus programs may flag them as malicious and delete them.

## Controls

Menus:
- Move up and down between options using the `W`, `S` or `↑`, `↓` keys on your keyboard.
- Switch between options using the `A`, `D` or `←`, `→` keys on your keyboard.
- Press `Enter` to enter the selected option.
- Press `Escape` or `Backspace` to go back in the menus or exit Circle Nom.
