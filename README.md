## Run Instructions

To run the source code, open the folder with your preferred IDE. Ensure you have `pygame` and  `gif-pygame` libraries installed; otherwise, the game won't work. Install them using:

```sh
pip install pygame
pip install gif-pygame
```

Alternatively, you can run the game using the executable found in the Releases section or create your own by running the `.spec` file with `pyinstaller`. Note: Both executables, whether from Releases or your own compilation, will **not** have a digital signature. As a result, some antivirus programs may flag them as malicious and delete them.

## Controls

- Move the character using `W`, `A`, `S`, `D` or the arrow keys on your keyboard.
- Toggle fullscreen mode using the `F11` key.
- Pause Circle Nom with the `P` key.
- Change the music using the `Q` & `E` keys - previous & next song.

## Goal

Score as many points as possible by eating randomly spawned food.
