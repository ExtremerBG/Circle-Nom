To run the source code you must open the folder with your IDE of choice.
If you dont have pygame library installed, the game won't work. 
Install it with pip install pygame.

The game can also be ran with the executable in the .EXE folder. Some antivirus will flag it as malicious!
If you want to make your own, there is a .spec file that will work with pyinstaller.
Be advised that again, some antivirus software may flag it as a malicious file, because it has no digital signature.

Enjoy!
